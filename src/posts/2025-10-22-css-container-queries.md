excerpt: Discovered how CSS container queries solve responsive design problems that media queries can't handle.

Today I learned about **CSS Container Queries** and they completely change how we think about responsive design!

## What Are Container Queries?

Unlike media queries that respond to the viewport size, container queries respond to the size of a containing element. This means components can be truly reusable and adaptive.

## Simple Example

```css
.card-container {
  container-type: inline-size;
}

@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    display: grid;
    grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr;
  }
}
```

## Why This Matters

- **Component-based responsive design**: Components adapt based on their container, not the viewport
- **True reusability**: Same component works in sidebar, main content, or anywhere
- **Better than media queries**: No need to write viewport-specific overrides

This is supported in all modern browsers now (2023+). Time to start using it!
