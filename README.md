## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+ and npm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm start
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:8080` with live reload.

### Building for Production

```bash
# Build static files
npm run build
```

The output will be in the `_site/` directory, ready to deploy.

## RSS Feed

Your blog automatically generates an RSS/Atom feed at `/feed.xml`. Readers can subscribe using any RSS reader app!

The RSS link appears in the footer of every page with an icon. To customize your feed:

1. Edit `src/_data/metadata.json` to update your site URL, author info, and description
2. The feed includes all posts with full content
3. Posts are automatically added when you build the site

RSS readers like Feedly, NewsBlur, or Apple News can subscribe to your feed.

## Apple Notes Integration (macOS only)

The easiest way to add content! Write your TiL notes in Apple Notes and import them with one command.

### Quick Workflow

```bash
# Fetch and publish latest note in one command
npm run publish
```

This will:
1. Get your latest note from Apple Notes
2. Convert it to Markdown
3. Add it to your blog
4. Build the site

### Detailed Commands

```bash
# Fetch latest note from Apple Notes and add to blog
npm run fetch-latest

# Fetch multiple notes (shows list to review before importing)
npm run fetch-notes
npm run import-notes
```

### Setting Up Apple Notes

For best results, create a folder called "TiL" in Apple Notes and keep your blog posts there. The scripts will:
- Look for notes in the "TiL" folder first
- Fall back to all notes if no "TiL" folder exists
- Convert HTML content to Markdown automatically
- Extract title and excerpt from your note
- Use the note's modification date as the post date

### Tips for Writing in Apple Notes

- **First line becomes the title**: Make it descriptive
- **Use headings**: They convert to Markdown headers
- **Format as usual**: Bold, italic, lists, and code blocks all convert properly
- **Links work**: URLs in Apple Notes become Markdown links

## Writing Posts Manually

Create a new Markdown file in `src/posts/` with the following format:

```markdown
---
layout: post.njk
title: Your Post Title
date: 2025-10-22
excerpt: A brief description of what you learned (optional)
---

Your content here in Markdown...

## Headings work

- Lists work
- Code blocks work

\`\`\`javascript
console.log('Code syntax highlighting works too!');
\`\`\`
```

### Post Naming Convention

Use this format: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-slug.md`

Example: `2025-10-22-css-container-queries.md`

## Customization

### Mobile-First Responsive Design

The CSS is built with a mobile-first approach:
- Base styles optimized for mobile phones (iPhone, Android)
- 16px base font size for excellent mobile readability
- Minimum 44px tap targets for touch interactions
- Progressive enhancement for tablets (600px+) and desktop (1024px+)
- Smooth scrolling on iOS with `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch`
- Prevents font scaling issues on iOS landscape mode

### Changing Theme Colors

Edit `src/css/style.css` and modify the CSS variables:

```css
:root {
  --accent: #58a6ff;        /* Change accent color */
  --bg-primary: #0d1117;    /* Change background */
  /* ... */
}
```

### Customizing RSS Feed

Edit `src/_data/metadata.json`:

```json
{
  "title": "Your Blog Name",
  "url": "https://yourblog.com",
  "description": "Your blog description",
  "author": {
    "name": "Your Name",
    "email": "you@example.com"
  }
}
```

### Changing Site Title

Edit `src/_includes/base.njk` to change the site title and subtitle.
